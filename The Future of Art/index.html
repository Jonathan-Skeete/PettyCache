				<h2>The History Of Art</h2>
				<p>
					This will provide some insight on famous artist and the origin of art.
				</p>
				<p id="researchHistory"></p>
				<h3>The Origin of Art</h3>
				<p id="originOfArt">
					Thousands of years ago, a man drew his own shadow; he took up a burnt
					stick and drew around it. He started to draw stick figures in the
					caves. This is how art got started. This legend refers to caveman
					drawings that are more than 30,000 years old. People then did not see
					it as art, but today we see drawing as a form of art. Most historians
					agree that if art had one place for where it started, it would be in
					Africa; African people who lived more than 70,000 years ago have drawn
					art and art objects.Art is one of those things that does not have a
					specific date or time when it started. Since the beginning of time,
					human beings have had this natural creative ability. Whether it was
					the caveman carving into the stones of a cave or someone wanting to
					sculpt or mold a lump of rock into something beautiful, we have wanted
					to find a way to create art since the beginning of time.

				<h3>Leonardo Davinci (15 April 1452 - 2 May 1519)</h3>

					alt="Leonardo Davinci Picture"
				/>
				<p>
					Leonardo is identified as one of the greatest painters in the history
					of art and is often credited as the founder of the High Renaissance.
					Despite having many lost works and fewer than 25 attributed major
					works—including numerous unfinished works—he created some of the most
					influential paintings in Western art. His magnum opus, the Mona Lisa,
					is his best known work and often regarded as the world's most famous
					painting. The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of
					all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is also regarded as a cultural
					icon. In 2017, Salvator Mundi, attributed in whole or part to Leonardo
					was sold at auction for US$450.3 million, setting a new record for the
					most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.

				<h3>The Mona Lisa (1503 - 1506)</h3>
				<img src="/Images/The_Mona_Lisa.png" alt="The Moa Lisa Image" />
				<h4>During the time of the Renaissance (1495 - 1597)</h4>

				<h3>Eugene Delacroix</h3>
				<img src="/Images/Eugene_Delacroix.png" alt="Eugene Delacroix Image" />
				<p>
					As a painter and muralist, Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes
					and his study of the optical effects of color profoundly shaped the
					work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired
					the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix
					illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish author
					Walter Scott, and the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
				</p>
				<h3>Liberty leading the People (1830)</h3>
				<img
					src="/Images/Liberty_leading_the_People.png"
					alt="Image of Liberty Leading the People"
				/>
				<h4>During the time of the Romanticism (1800 - 1850)</h4>
				<h3>Vincent Van Gogh (30 March 1853 - 29 July 1980)</h3>
				<img src="/Images/Vincent_Van_Gogh.png" alt="Image of Van Gogh" />
				<p>
					Van Gogh's early works consisted mostly of still lifes and depictions
					of peasant labourers. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members
					of the artistic avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin,
					who were seeking new paths beyond Impressionism. Frustrated in Paris
					and inspired by a growing spirit of artistic change and collaboration,
					Van Gogh moved to Arles in south of France in February 1888 with the
					goal of establishing an artistic retreat and commune. Once there, Van
					Gogh's art changed. His paintings grew brighter and he turned his
					attention to the natural world, depicting local olive groves, wheat
					fields and sunflowers. Van Gogh invited Gauguin to join him in Arles
					and eagerly anticipated Gauguin's arrival in the fall of 1888.

				<h3>The Starry Night Year (June 1889)</h3>
				<img
					src="/Images/The_Starry_Night.png"
					alt="Image of the Starry Night"
				/>
				<h4>During the time of Modern Art (1860s - 1870s)</h4>
				<h3>Pablo Picasso (5 October 1881 - April 8 1973)</h3>
				<p>
					Picasso's work is often categorized into periods. While the names of
					many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted
					periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901-1904), the Rose Period
					(1904-1906), the African-influenced Period (1907-1909), Analytic
					Cubism (1909-1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912-1919), also referred to
					as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and
					early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and his work in the mid-1920s
					often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines
					elements of his earlier styles.

				<h3>The Weeping Woman (September - October 1937)</h3>
				<img src="/Images/The_Weeping_Woman.png" alt="Image of weeping woman" />
				<h4>During the time of Cubism (1905 -1939)</h4>
				<h3>Carlo Carro</h3>
				<img src="/Images/Carlo_Carra.jpg" alt="Image of Carlo Carro" />
				<p>
					He is best known for his 1911 Futurist work, The Funeral of the
					Anarchist Galli. Carrà was indeed an anarchist as a young man but,
					along with many other Futurists, later held more reactionary political
					views, becoming ultranationalist and irredentist before and during the
					war. He supported fascism after 1918. In the 1930s, Carrà signed a
					manifesto which called for support of the state ideology through art.
					The Strapaese group he joined, founded by Giorgio Morandi, was
					strongly influenced by fascism and responded to the neo-classical
					guidelines which had been set by the regime after 1937, but was
					opposed to the ideological drive towards strong centralism. Carrà died
					in Milan in 1966.

				<h3>Funeral of the Anarchist (1910 - 1911)</h3>
				<img
					src="/Images/Funeral_of_the_Anarchist.png"

				<h4>During the time of Futurism (1909 - 1918)</h4>
				<h3>Jean-Michel Basquiat</h3>
				<img src="/Images/Jean-Michel_Basquiat.png" alt="Image of Basquiat" />
				<p>
					Basquiat's art focused on dichotomies such as wealth versus poverty,
					integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. He
					appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and
					image, abstraction, figuration, and historical information mixed with
					contemporary critique. He used social commentary in his paintings as a
					tool for introspection and for identifying with his experiences in the
					black community, as well as attacks on power structures and systems of
					racism. His visual poetics were acutely political and direct in their
					criticism of colonialism and support for class struggle.

				<h2>The Future of Art</h2>
				<fieldset>
					<h3>Opinion 1</h3>
					<fieldset>
						<p id="Person1">
							The art of the future will be transformed by holographic
							technology. Museums and galleries will display stunning 3D
							holographic works that seem to float in mid-air without any
							screens or supports. Holographic art will range from intricate
							sculptures that visitors can walk around and view from all angles
							to massive immersive installations that envelop the viewer in
							surreal dreamscapes of light and motion. Artists will create
							holographic living paintings that subtly shift and evolve over
							time. The imagery will change based on the viewer's perspective,
							adapting itself in real time to look different from various
							angles. Abstract geometrical shapes will kaleidoscopically
							transform as people interact with the artwork. Outdoor holographic
							art will also become popular. Cities could have entire holographic
							districts where fantastical alien landscapes, psychedelic visions,
							and surreal cityscapes are projected onto buildings and spill out
							onto the streets. Holographic creatures and characters will roam
							these urban wonderlands, playing and interacting with delighted
							tourist. Performance art will be reinvented by holograms.
							Holographic actors will star in avant-garde holographic theatre
							productions. Musicians could perform as volumetric holograms on
							stage, transforming in appearance during a concert. Holographic
							ballerinas and acrobats will amaze audiences with supernatural
							feats. The art of the future will break free of physical
							constraints and open portals to new dimensions using holograms.
							Artists will guide viewers into impossible worlds where the
							imagination can roam freely. Holographic art will profoundly
							change how people connect with art and alter the very notion of
							reality.
						</p>
					</fieldset>
				</fieldset>
				<fieldset>
					<h3>Opinion 2</h3>
					<fieldset>
						<p>
							Technology has evolved into one of the main powerhouses of the
							world, so too has Art. Art has transitioned throughout time
							beginning with cavemen drawing their shadows to the vibrant and
							expressive forms we see today. Generally, there is no distinctive
							description of what art will look like in the future due to the
							constant evolution and fast paced changes of our world, but I do
							think these evolutions in technology will play a big part in how
							art will be constructed and presented. I believe art will develop
							into a digital realm that will provide unique experiences not only
							for the developer but also its viewers. It will be focused on a
							more visual and intangible form more so than traditional paintings
							or drawings. AI's will play a big role in how it is presented and
							provide experiences for viewers that would be easily accessible
							along with a vibrant and clear cut imaging.
