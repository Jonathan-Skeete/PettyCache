				<h2>The History Of Art</h2>
				<p>
					This will provide some insight on famous artist and the origin of art.

				<h3>The Origin of Art</h3>
				<p id="originOfArt">
					Thousands of years ago, a man drew his own shadow; he took up a burnt
					stick and drew around it. He started to draw stick figures in the
					caves. This is how art got started. This legend refers to caveman
					drawings that are more than 30,000 years old. People then did not see
					it as art, but today we see drawing as a form of art. Most historians
					agree that if art had one place for where it started, it would be in
					Africa; African people who lived more than 70,000 years ago have drawn
					art and art objects.Art is one of those things that does not have a
					specific date or time when it started. Since the beginning of time,
					human beings have had this natural creative ability. Whether it was
					the caveman carving into the stones of a cave or someone wanting to
					sculpt or mold a lump of rock into something beautiful, we have wanted
					to find a way to create art since the beginning of time.

					<h3>Opinion 1</h3>
					<fieldset>
						<p id="Person1">
							The art of the future will be transformed by holographic
							technology. Museums and galleries will display stunning 3D
							holographic works that seem to float in mid-air without any
							screens or supports. Holographic art will range from intricate
							sculptures that visitors can walk around and view from all angles
							to massive immersive installations that envelop the viewer in
							surreal dreamscapes of light and motion. Artists will create
							holographic living paintings that subtly shift and evolve over
							time. The imagery will change based on the viewer's perspective,
							adapting itself in real time to look different from various
							angles. Abstract geometrical shapes will kaleidoscopically
							transform as people interact with the artwork. Outdoor holographic
							art will also become popular. Cities could have entire holographic
							districts where fantastical alien landscapes, psychedelic visions,
							and surreal cityscapes are projected onto buildings and spill out
							onto the streets. Holographic creatures and characters will roam
							these urban wonderlands, playing and interacting with delighted
							tourist. Performance art will be reinvented by holograms.
							Holographic actors will star in avant-garde holographic theatre
							productions. Musicians could perform as volumetric holograms on
							stage, transforming in appearance during a concert. Holographic
							ballerinas and acrobats will amaze audiences with supernatural
							feats. The art of the future will break free of physical
							constraints and open portals to new dimensions using holograms.
							Artists will guide viewers into impossible worlds where the
							imagination can roam freely. Holographic art will profoundly
							change how people connect with art and alter the very notion of
							reality.

					<h3>Opinion 2</h3>
					<fieldset>
						<p>
							Technology has evolved into one of the main powerhouses of the
							world, so too has Art. Art has transitioned throughout time
							beginning wih cavemen drawing their shadows to the vibrant and
							expressive forms we see today. Generally, there is no distinctive
							description of what art will look like in the future due to the
							constant evolution and fast paced changes of our world, but I do
							think these evolutions in technology will play a big part in how
							art will be constructed and presented. I believe art will develop
							into a digital realm that will provide unique experiences not only
							for the developer but also its viewers. It will be focused on a
							more visual and intangible form more so than traditional paintings
							or drawings. AI's will play a big role in how it is presented and
							provide experiences for viewers that would be easily accessible
							along with a vibrant and clear cut imaging.
