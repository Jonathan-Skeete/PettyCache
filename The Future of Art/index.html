					<h3>The Origin of Art</h3>
					<p id="originOfArt">
						Thousands of years ago, a man drew his own shadow; he took up a burnt
						stick and drew around it. He started to draw stick figures in the
						caves. This is how art got started. This legend refers to caveman
						drawings that are more than 30,000 years old. People then did not see
						it as art, but today we see drawing as a form of art. Most historians
						agree that if art had one place for where it started, it would be in
						Africa; African people who lived more than 70,000 years ago have drawn
						art and art objects.Art is one of those things that does not have a
						specific date or time when it started. Since the beginning of time,
						human beings have had this natural creative ability. Whether it was
						the caveman carving into the stones of a cave or someone wanting to
						sculpt or mold a lump of rock into something beautiful, we have wanted
						to find a way to create art since the beginning of time.

							Leonardo is identified as one of the greatest painters in the history
							of art and is often credited as the founder of the High Renaissance.
							Despite having many lost works and fewer than 25 attributed major
							works—including numerous unfinished works—he created some of the most
							influential paintings in Western art. His magnum opus, the Mona Lisa,
							is his best known work and often regarded as the world's most famous
							painting. The Last Supper is the most reproduced religious painting of
							all time and his Vitruvian Man drawing is also regarded as a cultural
							icon. In 2017, Salvator Mundi, attributed in whole or part to Leonardo
							was sold at auction for US $450.3 million, setting a new record for the
							most expensive painting ever sold at public auction.

							As a painter and muralist, Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes
							and his study of the optical effects of color profoundly shaped the
							work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired
							the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix
							illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish author
							Walter Scott, and the German author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

							Van Gogh's early works consisted mostly of still lifes and depictions
							of peasant labourers. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members
							of the artistic avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin,
							who were seeking new paths beyond Impressionism. Frustrated in Paris
							and inspired by a growing spirit of artistic change and collaboration,
							Van Gogh moved to Arles in south of France in February 1888 with the
							goal of establishing an artistic retreat and commune. Once there, Van
							Gogh's art changed. His paintings grew brighter and he turned his
							attention to the natural world, depicting local olive groves, wheat
							fields and sunflowers. Van Gogh invited Gauguin to join him in Arles
							and eagerly anticipated Gauguin's arrival in the fall of 1888.

							Picasso's work is often categorized into periods. While the names of
							many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted
							periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901-1904), the Rose Period
							(1904-1906), the African-influenced Period (1907-1909), Analytic
							Cubism (1909-1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912-1919), also referred to
							as the Crystal period. Much of Picasso's work of the late 1910s and
							early 1920s is in a neoclassical style, and his work in the mid-1920s
							often has characteristics of Surrealism. His later work often combines
							elements of his earlier styles.

							He is best known for his 1911 Futurist work, The Funeral of the
							Anarchist Galli. Carrà was indeed an anarchist as a young man but,
							along with many other Futurists, later held more reactionary political
							views, becoming ultranationalist and irredentist before and during the
							war. He supported fascism after 1918. In the 1930s, Carrà signed a
							manifesto which called for support of the state ideology through art.
							The Strapaese group he joined, founded by Giorgio Morandi, was
							strongly influenced by fascism and responded to the neo-classical
							guidelines which had been set by the regime after 1937, but was
							opposed to the ideological drive towards strong centralism. Carrà died
							in Milan in 1966.

							Basquiat's art focused on dichotomies such as wealth versus poverty,
							integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. He
							appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and
							image, abstraction, figuration, and historical information mixed with
							contemporary critique. He used social commentary in his paintings as a
							tool for introspection and for identifying with his experiences in the
							black community, as well as attacks on power structures and systems of
							racism. His visual poetics were acutely political and direct in their
							criticism of colonialism and support for class struggle.

							"The art of the future will be transformed by holographic
							technology. Museums and galleries will display stunning 3D
							holographic works that seem to float in mid-air without any
							screens or supports. Holographic art will range from intricate
							sculptures that visitors can walk around and view from all angles
							to massive immersive installations that envelop the viewer in
							surreal dreamscapes of light and motion. Artists will create
							holographic living paintings that subtly shift and evolve over
							time. The imagery will change based on the viewer's perspective,
							adapting itself in real time to look different from various
							angles. Abstract geometrical shapes will kaleidoscopically
							transform as people interact with the artwork. Outdoor holographic
							art will also become popular. Cities could have entire holographic
							districts where fantastical alien landscapes, psychedelic visions,
							and surreal cityscapes are projected onto buildings and spill out
							onto the streets. Holographic creatures and characters will roam
							these urban wonderlands, playing and interacting with delighted
							tourist. Performance art will be reinvented by holograms.
							Holographic actors will star in avant-garde holographic theatre
							productions. Musicians could perform as volumetric holograms on
							stage, transforming in appearance during a concert. Holographic
							ballerinas and acrobats will amaze audiences with supernatural
							feats. The art of the future will break free of physical
							constraints and open portals to new dimensions using holograms.
							Artists will guide viewers into impossible worlds where the
							imagination can roam freely. Holographic art will profoundly
							change how people connect with art and alter the very notion of
							reality." - Sulaiman Dem-Zerigat

							"Technology has evolved into one of the main powerhouses of the

							beginning with cavemen drawing their shadows to the vibrant and
							expressive forms we see today. Generally, there is no distinctive
							description of what art will look like in the future due to the
							constant evolution and fast paced changes of our world, but I do
							think these evolutions in technology will play a big part in how
							art will be constructed and presented. I believe art will develop
							into a digital realm that will provide unique experiences not only
							for the developer but also its viewers. It will be focused on a
							more visual and intangible form more so than traditional paintings
							or drawings. AI will play a big role in how it is presented and
							provide experiences for viewers that would be easily accessible
							along with a vibrant and clear cut imaging." - Kalisa Mckenzie

							"Art has always been a key contributor to the advancement of 
							civilization since the beginning of time. Whether it's paintings, 
							sculptures, cinema or music, artist expression promotes community. 
							And just like any community or civilization art has and will continue 
							to evolve or time. Technology shares the same significance and evolutionary 
							expectation as art. Transitioning from a chisel and stone to a digital tablet 
							and pen is synonymous with going from a rotary phone to a smart phone. 
							In today's world we have artificial intelligence, 3D printers, 
							and various software that can produce pieces of art that many find entertaining. 
							The future of art and technology are unbound and the collaboration of the two 
							make for an exciting experience.  However, conversations can be had about the 
							authenticity of modern art especially when its production is faster and more 
							readily available by AI. In my opinion art in not art without the passion of its creator. 
							For art to remain pure and authentic, the artists of the world need to remain passionate 
							about their work and use technology to aid in their artistic expression. Not replace it." - Jonathan Skeete
